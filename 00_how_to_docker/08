docker run -it --rm alpine /bin/sh

Normally, a Docker container persists after it has exited. This allows you to run the container again, inspect its filesystem, and so on. However, sometimes you want to run a container and delete it immediately after it exits. Docker provides the --rm command line option for this purpose:
This will create a container from the "my-docker" image and delete the container immediately after it exits. This helps to prevent having to clean up containers after you're done experimenting.
